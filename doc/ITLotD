IT Lesson Of The Day (ITLotD): *Regular Expressions*

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern.

Let's take our OLD _regex_:
```/XAUUSD (?<type>BUY|SELL)\s+ENTRADA: (?<entry>[\d.]+)\s+SL: (?<sl>[\d.]+)\s+(?<tps>.+)/```

This basically says:
   1. find the string "XAUUSD"
   2. followed by exactly one space
   3. followed by either "BUY" or "SELL" and store it in the variable `type`
   4. followed by at least one white-space character
   5. followed by the string "ENTRADA:"
   6. followed by exactly one space
   7. followed by at least one digit or period and store it in the variable `entry`
   8. followed by at least one white-space character
   9. followed by the string "SL:"
  10. followed by exactly one space
  11. followed by at least one digit or period and store it in the variable `sl`
  12. followed by at least one white-space character
  13. and take the rest of the tip and store it in the variable `tps`

So the space from step six (6) was missing and the whole sequence got aborted.

So the new regex looks like:
```/XAUUSD (?<type>BUY|SELL)\s+ENTRADA:\s*(?<entry>[\d.]+)\s+SL:\s*(?<sl>[\d.]+)\s+(?<tps>.+)/```

which replaces the space in steps #6 & #10 from " " to "\s*" which instead of looking for only one space will now be ok with on space, lots of spaces or even no spaces.
